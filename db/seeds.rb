Character.create!(name: 'Scarecrow', description: 'Boneless  with  a  face  made  of  sackcloth  and  a  body  of  old clothes  and  rags  Scarecrow  is stuffed  with  straw  so  when  he  gets  damaged  he  just  pushes  the  straw  back  in  and  mends the  hole in  any way  he  can.  As  a  result, in  places  he  has  large  rough stitching  and  patches and at one point his abdomen is held together with duct tape.', alliance: 'good', abilities: 'He is fiercely  smart after the Wizard gave him a certificate and filled his head with pins so he is sharp as a pin. But wisdom is different from knowledge and he rules over Oz with a naivet√© that is almost childlike.', origin: 'Built by a farmer to scare the crows Scarecrow simply came to life and being only four days old at his coronation is unsure how to fulfill his duties so is more likely to be seen carrying his crown than wearing it.')
